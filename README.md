Bus Seat Reservation System

The following console-based program is designed to create a simple bus seat reservation system that allows users to reserve, change, and cancel seats as needed.

Once the program is run, a menu with five options will be displayed, prompting users to enter their choice. Depending on the selected option, the program will execute one of the following functions at a time:

- Show available seats, marking any taken seats with an "X"
- Reserve a seat of the user’s choice under his/her name, provided that the seat is available
- Change an existing reservation to a new available seat
- Cancel a previous booking, making the seat available again
- Exit the program safely

The system displays a 5 × 10 grid representing the layout of the bus. It also includes input validation, preventing users from booking unavailable seats, double booking, or entering an invalid menu choice.

It should be noted that the data is temporarily stored during execution and resets once the program is terminated.

This program was developed using C++ and incorporates basic elements such as:

- Loops
- Arrays
- Functions
- Pointers(passing by address)

Compile and run the program using any C++ compiler.
